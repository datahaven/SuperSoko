Instructions
------------

It's Sokoban! Do you really need to ask?

Use the cursor keys to move your player (represented by an arrow) around the warehouse.
Push all of the boxes onto a goal square to finish the level.

Game In A Day Project
---------------------

The idea of GIAD was to see if I could write a playable game within one day. I did
this for a number of reasons:

* To get more experience of writing code to a deadline.
* To test the viability of using Cocos2D-X as a library for prototyping ideas.
* To see how much it is possible to do in one day.
* To have another finished project to add to my website.
* To learn some new technology, especially Cocos2D-X
* For fun!

Please note that this source code is not intended to be an example of how to
code well. It was written quickly and various shortcuts were taken. It also may not be
demonstrating correct use of Cocos2D-X.

You are welcome to take this code and do whatever you like with it.

Feedback on this project is welcome at adrian@adriandale.com

Building the Code
-----------------

This code builds in Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010
I wrote it using cocos2d-1.0.1-x-0.12.0, although you be able to get it to build
against other versions.
I created it as a Project inside the Solution that builds the Cocos2D-X library.
